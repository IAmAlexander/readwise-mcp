# Readwise MCP Implementation Progress Review

Based on the merged implementation plan, here's a review of what has been accomplished and what needs to be done next.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Fix Linter Errors and Core Functionality
- ✅ Fixed missing Logger module error 
- ✅ Implemented transport-aware logging system
- ✅ Updated Base Prompt implementation to match BaseMCPTool pattern
- ✅ Verified ReadwiseAPI class implementation
- ✅ Completed core tools implementation:
  - ✅ GetBooksTool
  - ✅ GetHighlightsTool
  - ✅ GetDocumentsTool
  - ✅ SearchHighlightsTool

### Partial Progress
- ⚠️ MCP Prompts implementation (partially complete)
- ⚠️ Server Implementation updates (in progress)
- ⚠️ Setup Wizard functionality (basic implementation complete, needs testing)

## Tasks for Tomorrow

### Complete Phase 1
1. **Finish MCP Prompts Implementation**
   - Complete ReadwiseHighlightPrompt implementation
   - Complete ReadwiseSearchPrompt implementation
   - Ensure proper error handling in prompt implementations
   - Add detailed JSDoc comments

2. **Complete Server Implementation**
   - Finish tool and prompt registration
   - Implement proper error handling for server responses
   - Ensure correct handling of transport modes
   - Add health check endpoint

3. **Finalize Setup Wizard**
   - Test API key storage and retrieval
   - Verify wizard flow with and without existing configuration
   - Add secure storage mechanisms

4. **Implement Protocol Compliance Checks**
   - Add validation for MCP message format
   - Ensure correct handling of JSON-RPC style communication
   - Add error handling for malformed messages

### Begin Phase 2: Testing and Verification
1. **Start Creating Test Suite**
   - Set up testing framework
   - Create initial unit tests for API client
   - Create tests for at least one tool implementation
   - Begin integration test setup

2. **Prepare for Manual Testing**
   - Set up test environment
   - Create test cases for CLI and transport modes
   - Prepare actual Readwise API key for testing

## Progress Summary

We've made solid progress on Phase 1, completing the core infrastructure and fixing critical issues. The main components of the MCP server are in place, but we need to finalize the prompt implementations and server configuration. The transport-aware logging system is working correctly, which was a critical requirement for MCP protocol compatibility.

For tomorrow, we should focus on completing Phase 1 entirely and beginning the testing phase to verify our implementation works as expected. If time permits, we can also start implementing some of the code quality improvements from Phase 3.

## Notes for Implementation

1. Remember to follow MCP best practices for error handling and response formatting
2. Ensure all tools and prompts have proper validation and error recovery
3. Keep an eye on logging to make sure it doesn't interfere with the protocol
4. Document any API changes or new features as they're implemented

This approach will allow us to have a functional Readwise MCP server by the end of tomorrow that can be tested with the MCP Inspector tool and begin addressing any issues discovered during testing.
