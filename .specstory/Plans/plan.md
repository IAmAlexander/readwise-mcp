# Readwise MCP Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps needed to complete the Readwise Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation, addressing current issues and ensuring a fully functional integration that follows MCP best practices.

## Current State Analysis

The codebase already has several key components implemented:

1. **API Client**: Basic Readwise API client with error handling
2. **Type Definitions**: Core type definitions for MCP operations
3. **Server Structure**: Basic MCP server structure with stdio and SSE transport
4. **Utils**: Logger, SSE server, configuration, and validation utilities
5. **Base Classes**: Base tool and prompt classes
6. **Tool Implementations**: Initial implementations of all required tools
7. **Prompt Implementations**: Initial implementations of required prompts
8. **Main Entry Point**: CLI implementation with argument parsing

**Current Issues:**
- Linter error in server.ts regarding missing './utils/logger' module
- Need to verify that all components work together correctly
- Need to ensure proper error handling across the entire application
- Documentation updates required to reflect implementation details
- Need to implement or verify setup wizard functionality for first-time configuration
- Transport-aware logging needs to be properly integrated
- Need to verify compliance with MCP protocol specifications

## Phase 1: Fix Linter Errors and Core Functionality

### 1. Fix Missing Logger Module Error

The error relates to the import of the Logger class from './utils/logger'. The file exists but might not be properly recognized by TypeScript.

**Steps:**
1. Verify that the Logger class is exported correctly from 'src/utils/logger.ts'
2. Check for proper references in tsconfig.json
3. Verify import paths across the codebase for consistency

### 2. Address Logging Issues

Based on MCP best practices, logging is a "huge footgun" that can interfere with the MCP protocol.

**Steps:**
1. Implement a strict transport-aware logging system that:
   - Never logs to stdout when using stdio transport
   - Uses stderr or file logging for stdio transport mode
   - Properly formats and encodes log messages to not interfere with JSON message processing
2. Add debug mode that can be toggled with environment variables or CLI flags
3. Add log filtering based on log levels

### 3. Complete or Verify Required Tools

**Steps:**
1. Verify implementation of all core tools:
   - GetBooksTool
   - GetHighlightsTool
   - GetDocumentsTool
   - SearchHighlightsTool
2. Ensure each tool correctly implements the BaseMCPTool interface
3. Verify proper parameter validation in each tool
4. Check error handling patterns in tool implementations
5. Add detailed JSDoc comments following MCP specifications
6. Ensure schema definitions match the tool implementations

### 4. Complete or Verify MCP Prompts

**Steps:**
1. Verify implementation of all core prompts:
   - ReadwiseHighlightPrompt
   - ReadwiseSearchPrompt
2. Ensure each prompt correctly implements the BaseMCPPrompt interface

4. Verify that prompts follow MCP protocol specifications

### 5. Ensure Setup Wizard Functionality

**Steps:**
1. Verify the implementation of the setup wizard for first-time configuration
