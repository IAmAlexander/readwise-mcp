_**User**_

How can we improve on the features we have here or what else can be added?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you explore ways to improve the current Readwise video features and suggest new additions based on the Readwise Reader API documentation.

Looking at the API documentation and our current implementation, I can see several opportunities for enhancement. Let's analyze what we have and what we could add:

## Potential Improvements and New Features

### 1. Enhanced Video Metadata Support

I notice the Readwise API supports various metadata fields that we could better utilize for videos:

Let's also check the README to understand the current features:

---

Read file: README.md

Let's also check if there are any test files related to video features:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory tests • **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `bulk-operations.test.ts` |
| 📄 `tags.test.ts` |
| 📄 `status.test.ts` |

</details>

Let's look at the video features test file:

---

Read file: tests/video-features.test.ts

---

Read file: tests/video-features.test.ts

---

Now let's check the Readwise API documentation to understand what's available:

Let's try a web search to get information about the Readwise Reader API:

Based on my research of the current implementation and the Readwise Reader API, here are several improvements and new features we could add to enhance the video features:

## 1. Enhanced Video Metadata and Organization

### Improvements:
- **Advanced Video Filtering**: Add the ability to filter videos by duration, source platform (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.), and date added.
- **Video Collections**: Allow users to organize videos into collections or playlists.
- **Video Tags Management**: Implement a more robust tagging system specifically for videos.

Let's create a new demo page for enhanced video organization:

_**User**_

why did you stop?

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for stopping abruptly. I was in the middle of creating a new demo file for enhanced video organization features, but I should have first completed my analysis and recommendations before implementing any changes.

Let me continue with a comprehensive list of potential improvements and new features for the Readwise video integration:

## Potential Improvements and New Features

### 1. Enhanced Video Metadata and Organization

Would you like me to implement any of these features specifically? I can create a demo page for any of these feature sets or enhance the existing video features demo with some of these capabilities.

let's do these for the trancripts

2. Improved Transcript Interaction
Transcript Search: Add ability to search within video transcripts
Transcript Export: Allow exporting transcripts to text or markdown
Transcript Summarization: Use AI to generate summaries of video content

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll implement the improved transcript interaction features you've selected. Let's enhance our existing demo with transcript search, export, and summarization capabilities.

First, I'll create a new version of our video features demo that includes these transcript enhancements:

---

Read file: demo/video-features.html

---

Now I'll create an enhanced version of the video features demo with the transcript improvements:

---

_**User**_

Why do you keep stopping?

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the interruptions. Let me complete the task without stopping. I'll create the enhanced transcript features demo file in one go:

---



---



---

_**User**_

Ok you stopped again - what's the problem?

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there might be an issue with the edit_file tool when creating a new file from scratch. Let's try a different approach by using the run_terminal_cmd tool to create the file:

---

```bash
touch demo/enhanced-transcript-features.html
```

```
alex@Mac readwise-mcp % 

```

---

Now that we've created the file, let's edit it:
